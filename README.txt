This program takes a collection of .mp4 files and will play them in sequence and can optionally add in some visual effects.
This may be useful for people creating video content on YouTube who have a collection of clips and want to 
quickly put them together. The user could then record the output of the program using something like OBS, and use that in a video editor.

HOW TO USE
Build the executable in Unity and click Start. Select a folder with all your mp4 clips in. They will then play in order, or if randomize
is selected, they will play in a random order. However, clips will play indefinitely in this mode at this point because it will reselect clips that have already been selected.
NOTE: This program still in an early state with not many features implemented yet.
