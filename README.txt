This program takes a collection of .mp4 files and will play them in a random order with random visual effects.
This may be useful for people creating video content on YouTube who have a collection of clips and want to 
quickly put them together. The user could then record the output of the program, and use that in a video editor.

HOW TO USE
Currently, put the files in the specified path, and number each clip from 1 up until the max number of clips.
So, if there are 10 clips, you should have files named 1,2,3,4... 10.
